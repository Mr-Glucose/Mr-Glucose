# Hey there! I'm Arthur 👋  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a self-taught programmer, graphic designer, and full-stack developer in the making. But let’s be real—I'm also just a guy who loves to learn, create, and kick a soccer ball around.  

## 🌟 What I’m All About
- **Code & Creativity**: Mixing tech with design to make cool stuff.  
- **Helping Communities**: Empowering people with digital skills (shoutout to Haiti 🇭🇹).  
- **Always Learning**: Whether it’s coding, writing, or just figuring life out.  

## 🌍 Fun Facts About Me
- I speak **English**, **French**, **Creole** and I’m dabbling in **Spanish** (¡hola!).  
- I can probably convince you to buy something with my **copywriting** skills.  
- When I’m not coding, you’ll catch me writing stories, running, or dreaming up my next big idea.  

## 🎯 Stuff I Do for Fun or not
- **Soccer**: ⚽ My first love. 2nd & 3rd National division. Still dreaming big with it.  
- **Creative Writing**: Working on stories that might just turn into novels someday.  
- **Copywriting**: Crafting words that sell without being pushy.  
- **Reading**: Anything inspiring, deep, or just plain fun.  
- **Running**: Clears my mind and keeps me moving.  

## 💻 Projects I'm Proud Of
- **[Store Rating App](https://github.com/Mr-Glucose/RatingAPP)**: Making it easier for customers to rate store experiences.  
- **Better YOU**: Empowering underserved communities with tech and knowledge.
